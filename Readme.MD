# ðŸ§  Face Recognition System using DeepFace and SVM

This project is a **Real-Time Face Recognition System** built with **OpenCV**, **DeepFace**, and **Scikit-learn (SVM)**.  
It captures faces from a webcam, generates embeddings using **DeepFaceâ€™s ArcFace model**, and classifies them with a **pre-trained SVM model**.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Real-time face detection** using OpenCVâ€™s Haarcascade classifier  
- **Face embedding extraction** using DeepFace (ArcFace model)  
- **SVM-based face classification** for recognition  
- **Multi-threaded prediction** to keep video streaming smooth  
- **Live labeling** of recognized faces on the camera feed  
- **Model loading via Joblib** (scaler + trained SVM)
